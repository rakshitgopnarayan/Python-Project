#Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language used by multiple giant companies.
It has simple and easy to use syntax making it perfect language for someone trying to learn computer programming for first time.
It is a high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code.

In this Project, we will use random module to make a word guessing game.
This game is for beginners learning to code in python and to give them a little brief about using strings, loops and conditional(If, else) statements.

In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will choose 1 random word.
The user first has to input their names and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet.
If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.
User will be given 10 turns(can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.

This is a Python script of the classic game "Hangman".
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes.
If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.
The player has 10 turns to guess the word.
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters.
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions.
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the player looses one turn out of total turns(which is actually 10 in our game),
If player still not able to guess the correct word then The game is over(when player completes total number of turns).

So, it is basically a TWO PLAYER game.But in our project a single player plays the game and the rules are followed by the program.

Hangman is used often by teachers to practice spelling, vocabulary and just for fun.
The most popular way to play hangman games offline is to draw blank letters for the chosen word on a paper or on the blackboard and let the players guess the letters.
For each incorrect guess, another part of the man is drawn.
If the picture is complete before the word is revealed the hangman game is lost and the character is hanged, if the word is revealed before the execution the game is won.
